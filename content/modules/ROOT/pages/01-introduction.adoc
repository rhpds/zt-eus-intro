== What is Extended Update Support (EUS)?

EUS is an optional offering for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
subscribers. With Extended Update Support, Red Hat provides backports of
Critical and Important impact security updates and urgent-priority bug
fixes for a predefined set of minor releases of Red Hat Enterprise
Linux. EUS enables customers to remain with the same minor release of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux for 24 months, allowing for stable production
environments for mission-critical applications.

== Why would you use EUS?

Traditional systems administration logic suggests that one would upgrade
to the latest release as it becomes available. However, certain
workloads or environments may require a more static environment while
still maintaining vendor support:

* Some sensitive production workloads may require minimal infrastructure
changes.
* Some organizations require the entire application stack be certified
with every minor release
* Certain independent software vendors (ISVs) may only certify specific
RHEL minor releases.

Red Hatâ€™s EUS program enables partners and customers alike to
standardize on specific minor versions without the need for orbitrary
decisions. Since RHEL 4.5, Red Hat Enterprise Linux has provided EUS.
Since RHEL 8.0, the standard for EUS releases is to support *.0 and
every even numbered release. (This policy has been upheld for RHEL 9.x
as well.)

== Verifying Extended Update Support Availability

Extended Update Support is an offering and therefore requires a
subscription to enable the expected functionality. From the OS level,
you are able to determine whether a system has the EUS add-on available:

[source,bash,run]
----
subscription-manager repos | grep -i eus
----

In the following steps, you will look at how to register your system
with EUS and upgrade inbetween EUS releases. However, before you
subscribe your system to an EUS release, it is important to note which
release your system is running. This information is stored in the file
`+/etc/redhat-release+`

[source,bash,run]
----
cat /etc/redhat-release
----
