While EUS versions are supported for 24 months, it is a good practice to
stay on as current a release as possible. However, some environments
require recertification or are running software that the vendor only
certifies for specific minor releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. In
those circumstances, upgrading between EUS releases is the necessary
balance.

In order to see which releases are available for your system’s current
major release, you will use the `+subscription-manager+` command:

....
subscription-manager release --list
....

Before you upgrade to the lastest minor EUS release, it is worth noting
that checks are built-in to ensure a system doesn’t inadvertantly get
updated to the absolute latest release. For instance, RHEL 9.6 is the
current minor release but is _not_ an EUS release. Try setting 9.6 as
the current release:

....
subscription-manager release --set=9.6
dnf clean all
dnf list --updates| wc -l
....

You receive several errors indicating the requested content could not be
found. Now, select the correct release and verify there are packages
available for update:

....
subscription-manager release --set=9.0
dnf clean all
dnf list --updates| wc -l
....

Update your system to the latest packages in this EUS release:

....
dnf update -y
....

Note: Your system’s output may vary slightly from the example:

Now that you have the lastest packages availble in this EUS
repositories, verify the minor version of RHEL is the same as Step 2:

....
cat /etc/redhat-release
....

Notice that with all the latest available packages installed, the server
is still running RHEL 9.0. There is a newer EUS release available. In
the final step, you will see how to upgrade between EUS versions.
